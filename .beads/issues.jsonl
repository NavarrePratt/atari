This identifies root items (epics + standalone beads) and filters to descendants of the selected top-level item.\n\n# Technical Approach\n1. Add method to identify top-level items:\n   - Query `br list --json` to get all beads\n   - Find roots: epics + beads with no parent\n   - Sort by priority (ascending), then creation time\n\n2. Add `NextTopLevel()` method to Manager:\n   - If activeTopLevel is set and has ready descendants, use it\n   - Otherwise, identify all top-level items, pick highest priority with ready work\n   - Filter beads to descendants of selected top-level item\n   - Apply existing filterEligible logic\n   - Return highest priority descendant\n\n3. Track active top-level in Manager struct (runtime state)\n\n4. Handle exhaustion: clear activeTopLevel when no ready descendants\n\n# Key Files\n- internal/workqueue/queue.go - main implementation\n- internal/workqueue/queue_test.go - unit tests\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Top-level items correctly identified (epics + parentless beads)\n- [ ] NextTopLevel() selects from active top-level's descendants\n- [ ] Exhausted top-level items are cleared\n- [ ] Unit tests cover: multi-epic scenarios, standalone beads, exhaustion\n\n# Verification\n- [ ] `mise run lint` passes\n- [ ] `mise run test` passes\n\nIf implementation reveals new issues, create separate issues for investigation.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-20T23:04:31.704414Z","created_by":"npratt","updated_at":"2026-01-20T23:12:11.617343Z","closed_at":"2026-01-20T23:12:11.617299Z","close_reason":"Implemented NextTopLevel() selection mode in workqueue with activeTopLevel tracking, helper methods for identifying/selecting top-level items, and comprehensive tests covering multi-epic, standalone, and exhaustion scenarios.
